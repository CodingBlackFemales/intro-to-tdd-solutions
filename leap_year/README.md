# Leap Year Exercise Solution

# Task

Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not.

# To Consider

- Years divisible by 400 are leap years (e.g. 2000 was a leap year)
- Years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are not leap years (e.g. 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years)
- Years divisible by 4 but not by 100 are leap years (e.g., 2008, 2012, 2016)
- Years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years (e.g. 2017, 2018, 2019)
